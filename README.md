# UniversityManagementSystem
The University Management System is a secure and scalable software application designed to manage the administra-tive, academic, and personal data of teachers and students. The system will allow admin, teachers, and students to have a personalized account where they can access and manage their own data.![image](https://github.com/RohanSoni-02/UniversityManagementSystem/assets/110955425/8fe8dcc6-5862-47cb-ac01-d333dbc13a60)

# Business Scenario
The University Management System is designed for educational institutions that need a centralized and efficient way of managing their resources. The system will help the institution to manage data related to admissions, academics, and administration, in a more organized way. This system will improve the overall efficiency of the institution and provide a better user experience for teachers and students.
Only the administrators of the university management system can perform the normal CRUD operations. Administrator can add, delete, edit, and review individual teacher’s and student’s record. All information of the teacher’s and student’s record (except their id, the primary key) can be changed including individual’s password by the admin. 
Teachers can review their own details (excluding password), but not other teachers and can change their own details (including password), but not other teachers. But the teachers can review details of all the students (excluding password).
Students can review their own details (excluding password), but not other students and can change their own details (in-cluding password), but not other students.
The software can be used to manage student and teacher data, course schedules, grading systems, and other important information related to academics and administration. By using the University Management System, institutions can re-duce the manual effort required to manage these processes, which can save time and reduce the likelihood of errors.
